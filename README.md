# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains custom implementations of various machine learning algorithms, built from scratch in Python. The implementations are designed to help understand the inner workings of these models by providing clear and concise code examples.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Classification Algorithms
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Implementation of SVM for binary classification tasks, utilizing a linear kernel.
- **Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)**: A generative learning algorithm assuming Gaussian distribution for each class.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Classification based on linear decision boundaries, maximizing the separation between multiple classes.
- **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**: Similar to LDA but allows for quadratic decision boundaries, providing more flexibility.

### Gradient Descent Algorithms
- **Gradient Descent**: General implementation of the gradient descent optimization algorithm.
- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Performs gradient descent using the entire dataset at once, ensuring stable convergence.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: An iteration of gradient descent that updates parameters using one data point at a time, providing faster but noisier convergence.

### Ensemble Methods
- **Decision Trees / Random Forests**: Implementation of decision trees for classification tasks, along with a basic random forest ensemble method.
